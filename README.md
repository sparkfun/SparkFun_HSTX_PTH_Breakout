[*SparkFun HSTX PTH Breakout (BOB-28467)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-hstx-pth-breakout.html)

The SparkFun HSTX PTH Breakout is a simple board designed to work with the HSTX connector on the IoT RedBoard - RP2350 and the camera and display connectors on a Rasbperry Pi 5. It breaks out all 22 of the pins used on these connectors to a standard 0.1"-spaced plated through hole header. These 22-pin connectors interface with a matching flexible cable and normally connect directly to other peripherals (cameras, displays, etc.).

Intended for prototyping with the IoT RedBoard - RP2350, this board breaks out all four differential pairs on the connector along with I<sup>2</sup>C signals (data/clock) and power (3.3V & Ground).
